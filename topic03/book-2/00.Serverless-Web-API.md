## Serverless REST API.

In the previous lab, we developed a simple serverless app where each lambda function had a unique URL. A better design would be to have a uniform interface to the lambda functionality. We can achieve this by placing an AWS API Gateway between the client and the backend. The Gateway allows us to define a RESTful interface to the backend, and still retaining the serverless theme. The diagram below shows our target infrastructure:

### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. It's a partial solution to the previous lab  with minor filename changes, e.g. `lib/simple-app.ts` renamed `lib/rest-api-stack.ts`. Import it into VS Code and type the commands
~~~bash
$ npm install
Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
In the management console, check Cloudformation for the new stack:
