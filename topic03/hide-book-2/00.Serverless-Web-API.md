## Serverless REST API.

In the previous lab, we developed a simple serverless app where each lambda function had a unique URL. A better design would be to have a uniform entry point to the lambda functionality by placing an AWS API Gateway between the client and the backend. The Gateway allows us to define a REST interface to the backend using serverless technology. The diagram below shows our target infrastructure:

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. It's the solution to the previous lab with minor filename changes, e.g. lib/simple-app.ts renamed lib/rest-api-stack.ts. Import it into VS Code and type the commands
~~~bash
$ npm install
Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
In the management console, Check Cloudformation for the new stack:
