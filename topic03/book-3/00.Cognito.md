# Cognito Authentication.

In this lab, we will use the AWS Cognito service to add user authentication to a simple web API. The associated CDK app will provision the following AWS resources:

+ A Cognito User pool.
+ An API to perform Authentication processing - The Auth web API.
+ An API to demonstrate public and protected REST endpoints - The App web API.
+ A custom authorizer to prevent unauthorized requests accessing protected routes of the App API..

A visual representation of the stack is demonstrated below:

The Auth API endpoints (REST resources) allow a user to issue the following requests:

+ SignUp.
+ SignUp confirmation.
+ SignIn.
+ Sign-out.

### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. Import it into VS Code and type the following commands:

~~~bash
$ npm install
+ npm run schema
Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
The code in `lib/auth-app-stack.ts` provisions a Cognito User Pool, an AppClient for this pool, and a skeleton REST API. In the AWS management console, go to Cognito Service --> User Pools (left panel), and confirm the creation of the user pool:

![][userpool]

The stack in `lib/auth-app-stack.ts` declares some private instance variables, i.e.
~~~ts
export class AuthAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  private auth: apig.IResource;
  private userPoolId: string;
  private userPoolClientId: string;
~~~
These variables are initialized in the constructor method, for example:
~~~ts
    this.userPoolId = userPool.userPoolId;
~~~
These variables are accessible by any of the class' methods (see later). 

As the authentication web API (Auth API) will have several elements that are similar in structure, we can avoid code duplication by defining a private method for declaring them. In `lib/auth-app-stack.ts`, define the method as follows:
~~~ts
export class AuthAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  private auth: apig.IResource;
  private userPoolId: string;
  private userPoolClientId: string;

  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    .... as before .....
  }
// NEW
  private addAuthRoute(
    resourceName: string,
    method: string,
    fnName: string,
    fnEntry: string,
    allowCognitoAccess?: boolean
  ): void {
    const commonFnProps = {
      architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
      timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(10),
      memorySize: 128,
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_22_X,
      handler: "handler",
      environment: {
        USER_POOL_ID: this.userPoolId,
        CLIENT_ID: this.userPoolClientId,
        REGION: cdk.Aws.REGION
      },
    };
    
    const resource = this.auth.addResource(resourceName);
    
    const fn = new node.NodejsFunction(this, fnName, {
      ...commonFnProps,
      entry: `${__dirname}/../lambda/auth/${fnEntry}`,
    });

    resource.addMethod(method, new apig.LambdaIntegration(fn));
  }  // end private method
} // end class
~~~

Commit this work:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Setup for Auth APII."

### Verified Sender Identities.

By default, an AWS account is in __sandbox mode__. Consequently, you can only use the AWS SES (Simple Email Service) to send emails to __verified sender identities__, with a limit of 200 emails daily. A verified sender identity is an email address or domain that you own. 

In this lab's application, we want to email users on signup. Therefore, you must first add their email address to your verified sender identities. Create a verified sender identity for any email addresses you can access by performing the steps in [this guide][vsi] (scroll to the section titled "Creating an email address identity" on the page). We will use these email addresses when demonstrating user registration later.
