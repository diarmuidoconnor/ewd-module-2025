## Exercise 1 (Static Component)

[Start the Storybook server if it is not already running.]

Suppose we want a static React component that renders a view similar to that illustrated below: 

![][exercise1]

(Substitute your course title and module names, if necessary. For now, assume exactly two modules in the table body.]

The following raw HTML table syntax is a guide for generating the modules list in the above screenshot:
~~~
<table className="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>No lectures</th>
      <th>No practicals</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody >
    <tr>
      <td>DevOps</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Enterprise Web Dev</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody >
</table>
~~~

__You are required__ to implement the new component. For convenience, a story is  provided - see `src/stories/exercises/01-component.stories.ts`.

The steps to completing this exercise are:

+ __Step 1__: In the Storybook UI in the browser, click the link: 'Samples -> 01 - static component'. Examine this story's related component code in `components/samples/01_staticComponent.tsx`.
+ __Step 2__: In the Storybook UI, click the link: 'Exercises -> 01 - static component' and open the related component file:  `components/exercises/01_staticComponent.tsx`. Change the component return statement to generate the output shown earlier. 

[If necessary, consult the 'Exercise 1 solution' in the last section of this lab.]
