## Exercise 1 (Static Component)

Make sure the Vite dev server is still running form the last step. If not, do the following:

~~~bash
npm run dev
~~~

In the browser (Vite page), use the dropdown and select **“Sample 01 - static component”** to see an example.

Suppose we want a static React component that renders a view similar to that illustrated below:

![][exercise1]

(Substitute your course title and module names, if necessary. For now, assume exactly two modules in the table body.)

The following raw HTML table syntax is a guide for generating the modules list:

~~~
<table className="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>No lectures</th>
      <th>No practicals</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>DevOps</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Enterprise Web Dev</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
~~~

__You are required__ to implement the component in:

- `src/components/exercises/01_staticComponent.tsx`

Steps:

+ __Step 1__: Inspect the sample component code in `src/components/samples/01_staticComponent.tsx`.
+ __Step 2__: Open `src/components/exercises/01_staticComponent.tsx` and replace the placeholder return value with TSX that produces the output shown above.
+ __Step 3__: In the browser dropdown select **“Exercise 01 - static component”** to see your implementation.

[If necessary, consult the 'Exercise 1 solution' in the last section of this lab.]
