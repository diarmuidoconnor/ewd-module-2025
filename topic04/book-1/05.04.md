## Exercise 4 (Iteration).

In the previous exercise, the component was hard-coded to expect a module array prop of exactly two elements. It should be flexible enough to handle any array size. __You are required__ to implement a solution to address this requirement and place it in `components/exercises/04_iteration.tsx`. Use `components/samples/04_iteration.tsx` as a guide.

The story for this exercise is implemented in `stories/exercises/04-component.stories.ts`.

The Storybook UI renders your solution on clicking 'Exercises -> 04 - iteration'. The  output should resemble the following:

![][exercise4] 



That completes the lab.
