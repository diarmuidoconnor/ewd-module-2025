## Exercise 2 (Embedded variables)

In Exercise 1 the course data was hard-coded in the TSX (course name and module details). A slight improvement is to place the data in local variables and reference them from the TSX.

__You are required__ to implement this improvement in:

- `src/components/exercises/02_embeddedVars.tsx`

Steps:

+ __Step 1__: In the browser dropdown select **“Sample 02 - embedded variables”** and inspect the code in `src/components/samples/02_embeddedVariables.tsx`.
+ **Step 2:** Copy your Exercise 1 implementation from `src/components/exercises/01_staticComponent.tsx` into `src/components/exercises/02_embeddedVars.tsx`.
+ __Step 3__: Modify the copied code to use embedded variables for its data (e.g. a two-element array for the modules). See the hint below.
+ __Step 4__: In the browser dropdown select **“Exercise 02 - embedded variables”** to see your result.

**Hint:** Define a `modules` array containing 2 elements. The TSX excerpt below is a guide to part of the solution:

~~~tsx
const modules = [
  { name: 'DevOps', noLectures: 2, noPracticals: 2 },
  { name: 'Enterprise Web Dev', noLectures: 3, noPracticals: 2 },
];
~~~
