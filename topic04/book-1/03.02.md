## Exercise 2 (Embedded variables).

In exercise 1 the course data was hard-coded in the TSX - course name, module details. A slight improvement would be to place the data in local variables and reference them from the JSX code. __You are required__ to implement this improvement.

For convenience, we will implement the component in a separate file - `src/components/exercises/02_embeddedVars.tsx`. The story for this exercise is already provided - see `src/stories/exercises/02-component.stories.ts`.

The steps to complete this exercise are as follows:

+ __Step 1__: In the Storybook UI in the browser, click the link: 'Samples -> 02 - JSX embedded variables'. Examine the related component code in `components/samples/02_embeddedVariables.tsx`.
+ **Step 2**: Copy the code from `components/exercises/01_staticComponent.tsx` to  `components/exercises/02_embeddedVars.tsx`.

+ __Step 3__: Modify the copied code to use embedded variables for its data, e.g. a two-element array for the modules. See the hint below.
+ **Step 4:** In the browser, click the link: 'Exercises -> 02 - JSX embedded variables' to see the result of your implementation. 

**Hint:** You will need to define a `modules` array containing 2 elements. The TSX excerpt below is a guide to part of the solution required:

~~~ tsx
  . . . . . . 
const modules = [
  { name: 'DevOps', noLectures: 2, noPracticals: 2 },
  { name: 'Enterprise Web Dev', noLectures: 3, noPracticals: 2 },
];
  . . . . . . . 
~~~
