## Exercise 3 (Props).

A further design improvement to our component is to make it __reusable__ by passing the data in as __props__.

The story for this exercise is implemented in `stories/exercises/03-component.stories.ts`.

+ Implement your solution in `components/exercises/03_props.tsx`. Use the code from exercise 2 as the starting point and reference `components/samples/03_props.tsx` as a guide to the changes required. **Note your component must use the same prop names as the story, i.e. course and modules.**

Click 'Exercises -> 03 component with props' in the Storybook UI to see your solution render.
