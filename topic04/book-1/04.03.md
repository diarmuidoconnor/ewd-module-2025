## Exercise 3 (Props)

A further design improvement to our component is to make it **reusable** by passing the data in as **props**.

__You are required__ to implement your solution in:

- `src/components/exercises/03_props.tsx`

Use the code from Exercise 2 as the starting point and reference `src/components/samples/03_props.tsx` as a guide.

**Important:** Your component must use the same prop names used by the lab runner in `App.tsx`:

- `course` (string)
- `modules` (array)

To view your work, in the browser dropdown select **“Exercise 03 - props”**.
