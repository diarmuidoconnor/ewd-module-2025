# Startup (Vite + React + TypeScript)

In this lab you will build a set of simple React components (samples + exercises) **inside a Vite project**.

Download and unzip [this archive](https://enterprisewebdev-2026-setu-deise.netlify.app/topic04/book-1/archives/archive-2.zip) and import it into VS Code. Open an integrated terminal in the editor and type:

```
npm install
```

[This installs the JS modules needed (e.g. React and its dependencies) in a local folder called `node_modules`.]

This lab contains a top-level folder structure similar to the following:

```
     basicReactLab
       |
       |---src
       |     |---assets
       |     |---components
       |     |     |---exercises
       |     |     |---samples
       |
       |---node_modules
       package.json
```

Your primary focus will be on the two sub-folders of `src/components`:  The `src/components/samplesfolder` contains the sample components discussed in the lectures; the `src/components/exercises` folder is where you will develop components in the following exercises. At the moment it  just contains placeholder components. 

> **Note:** You will get Typescript compile errors with two exercise files: 03_propr.tsx and 04_interation.tsx. **You can ignore these for now as you will (hopefully!!) fix them in the exercises.**

The `src/App.tsx`  contains code that lets you switch between **samples** and **exercises** in the browser and preserves Vite’s hot reload. This is included just to enable you to easily view the results of the exercises and switch to the samples - **you are not required to change or understand `App.tsx` at this stage** (you will in a few weeks though!!!)

That’s it. Run `npm run dev` , follow the instructions to open the app in the browser, and use the dropdown to view the sample/exercise components.
